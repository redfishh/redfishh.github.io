            <h3>Visual Analytics: Student Mental Health Resources (academic)</h3>

            <p><em>timeframe:</em> one month</p>

            <p>
                This project was overlooked by Professor Lyn Bartram during IAT355: Introduction to Visual Analytics. The main goal of this project was to create a tool that can be used by those looking into mental health resources for post-secondary students; while we are encouraged to include analytical questions for observational purposes, ultimately we were to focus more on the visual design of our data. I worked by myself for this project.

                This notebook was originally coded in Observable and uses Javascript and Markdown syntax to generate interactive visualizations.
