            <h3>Coquitlam Heritage Society Website Redesign</h3>

            <p><em>role:</em> Communications and Community Outreach Assisstant</p>
            <p><em>timeframe:</em> June 2023 - August 2023</p>

            <p>
                I was to redesign the website for the Coquitlam Heritage Society to make it easier to use for visitors to see what kind of events, exhibits, and workshops are offered at the museum. The organization wanted to bring in a younger audience as well and asked that I create a more modern design for their new website. For this project, I created a full prototype using Figma before moving to Squarespace and applying the design there. I found this to be a difficult task as Squarespace could not accomodate some of the features I have planned out in Figma and I had to adjust these designs accordingly. However, the website worked as intended and there is an increase in visitors using the website to sign up for events and workshops.
            </p>

            <p>The final website can be viewed <a href="https://www.coquitlamheritage.ca/">here</a></p>
