            <h3>Vancouver Fashion Week Web Experience Reform (academic)</h3>

            <p><em>timeframe:</em> three months</p>

            <p>This was a semester project with a four-man team. We worked with Vancouver Fashion Week to design a solution for their dwindling viewership since the migration to a virtual platform. This project was overlooked by SIAT professor Ron Wakkary. We were tasked to collaborate with a participant group and to find a design solution involving interaction design. This semester, our team had reached out to Vancouver Fashion Week (VFW) and had done extensive research on ethnography, user journeys, and design personas. Through this process we had also hosted two workshops to aid our concept idealization and had narrowed down our initial brainstorm process to a final concept.</p>
