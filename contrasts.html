        <h3>film synopsis</h3>
        <p>
          Grandmother Wong is a resident of Vancouver Chinatown. It is a place she remembers as lively, family-oriented, architecturally prominent, beautiful, and having a strong sense of Chinese culture. Now, the few streets that remain are renowned for homelessness and graffiti. They have become a place where hipsters, with an abundance of pocket cash, go to partake in “authentic” Chinese culture (to which, barely any remains).
        </p>

        <p>
          As she walks, cane-in-hand, along her memory of the gorgeous buildings that once lined Chinatown’s streets, she momentarily gets interrupted with the cold truth of what Chinatown has become. On one hand, she is living in a memory and remembering everything that Chinatown was. She thinks of its rich history, the enthusiastic residents, the vibrant architecture, and her family. On the other hand, as her cane beats along like the ticking of a clock, she starts to think about the rampant crime, loss of culture, empty houses, lack of people, and the new silence that fills the streets. Until finally, our heroine no longer exists. Similarly to how graffiti has covered the Chinese culture in Chinatown, she has been engulfed and overwhelmed by the paint-like ink.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, the film pivots into a reflective interview by the poet: Donna Seto. She introduces her poem Contrasts, current projects and discusses what Chinatown means to her. She also discusses the changes in the area, which contrasts her experience growing up. Finally, she leaves us with a reflective query: <em>in many ways Chinatown will always exist, but what is Chinese, and what is Chinatown?</em>

        <h3>film style</h3>

        <p>
          As Director of Videography, in addition to working the camera, I was in charge of deciding how we would film our
          response section. While our Director had already decided on a colour palette and
          general theme for our documentary, I was to look into different modes of documentary
          and find one that best suited our project.

        </p>

        <blockquote>
          For the documentary section of the film: this will be a participatory film, so the narrative style will be similar to a candid film style. We also want to feature photos and past videos during this part of the film. The narrative style will take inspiration from Flip A Coin (Amazutsumi, 2021) from 00:18:00 to 00:26:00 where the images cut in while Donna is talking, and the camera will follow her around as she talks. This should be realistic, as we are showing a part of Chinatown that should not be staged.

        <figcaption>Inspiration for our response portion was partially taken from

          <p>
            In addition to this, I was in charge of planning the treatment and structure
            of the response based on our research. The following is a small excerpt
            from our pitch package.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            Even though Chinatown in its current state is worn down by gentrification, there are still people who wish to revive its former flame. It's a place of connection, and through the efforts of several communities perhaps this connection would connect to those in the future. Places like the Chinatown Storytelling Centre and the Chinese Canadian Museum are both created to help with the revitalization of Chinatown. There are many merchants who banded together as a community to help recreate Chinatown along with its history. We hope to further interview these organizations to have a better grasp on their efforts and capture their feelings towards the current state of Chinatown.
            <br>
            <br>
            While we want to bring focus to Donna's perspective as the poet of the poem, we also want to bring in other voices to further emphasize the situation and amplify the voices of the locals who have to live through these hardships.

        <h3>press kit</h3>

        <p>
          In addition to my role as Director of Videography, I was to assist our Producer,
          Erika Hance, in creating materials to include in our press kit.
        </p>

        <p>
          I created a variety of posters for our film before settling on our final design.

          After our Producer had compiled all of our information for our kit, I
          had designed our final package to be released to the public. The following is the most recent version of our press kit.
